        <p> I was born prematurely because I shared the room with my twin sister,
            Fredericka, who was eating all the food. I had to get outta there ASAP. </p>

        <p> Some of my favorite childhood activities included</p>

          My name is  Frelicia, I'm the baby of the twins.
          Every game I play, you know I will win.

       <p story= "back ground"> I grew up with 2 beautiful sisters and a mom and a dad. 
           We didn't always have much, but we had a good life. I didn't get to see my dad 
           often because he was incarcerated, but I knew he loved and cared for me very much.

       <p storyCont="background+"> After his release, he helped sparked my interests in
           both STEM and sports by introducing to riddles and home science projects. Tragically
           he was killed only 2 years after being released, but I continue to remember his legacy
           by learning computer science and staying physically active today.
